# UWAQuickStartChallenge
Quick Start Challenge: Universal Windows Apps in Visual Studio

In this demo, we will introduce the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) on Windows 10. Now you can build one app that runs on all Windows 10 devices and design your pages so they render properly no matter what device is used to view them. Run your app on a Windows 10 phone, a Windows 10 desktop, or Xbox. With the introduction of the Windows 10 core and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), one app package can run across all platforms.
